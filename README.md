# RU-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT-3-SS_AL_MM_DP

## Overview of the project and its purpose
Our project takes a deep dive into diseases. 
We have found some fascinating discoveries.
With 3 different visualisations, we are able to share our data story.
Our dataset was based on research done throughout the United States on different diseases.
We had some questions that we were curious about when reading the dataset:
- How prevalent are certain diseases in each state and over time?
- For each disease, which ten states had the highest death count?
- Does a certain month have more or less deaths due to a certain disease?
- What are the amount of deaths per capita for a certain disease?
We created an interactive heat map of the USA that accurately portrays our data story.
We started with cleaning up the database, and narrowing down the diseases.
with that information, we created different databases that show several target aspects of our story.
.............................................

our first step was creating a map, allowing the user to choose a disease and look at it state by state.

...............................

Our second Visualization is a line graph which shows an accurate picture of the amount of ...........

...................

For our last graph we chose a bar graph so one can see in depth the disease according to the month.................

## Summarize ethical considerations made in the project
In our project we were cautious regarding ethical considertions. We were careful to look at the permissions that stated whether we were allowed to use the data, and how. The data set that we used is from the the CDC, which allows the use of data provided on their website at no cost and no restrictions. This was helpful as websites with stricter ways to use the data, would be more difficult to use.
